# POAPs-QiDao

Hi all from the POAP and QiDao communities!

These QiDao POAPs celebrate the circle and how it represents harmony, the balance of the yin and yang and the duality of nature.

They take inspiration from symbols of prosperity (I voted), longevity (4 years Locked), luck (AMA), and happiness (True Qimp).

It's been a blast learning about the QiDao community and creating these POAPs. I hope you like them.
